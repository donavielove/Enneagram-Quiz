# Enneagram-Quiz

Usage Notes: 

- Project Description: This project includes 3 .java files

  1. enneagramTest.java: This code is the part of the program that allows users to take the Enneagram Test, 
  where they will select one of two choices depending on which statement they relate to the most. 
  This program calculates the percent match the user is to each Enneagram type and provides the user with descriptions 
  of each enneagram type.
  
  2. typeAnswers.java: This class holds all the questions used in the Enneagram Test class
  
  3. main.java:  This main class allows the user to see the Enneagram Test GUI

- You must run this program on an IDE that can compile Java Code. I created this program with the Eclipse IDE,
  therefore, running the program on the same IDE or a similar one would be ideal.

- To formulate the questions and Enneagram Test results I used this free RHETI Sampler as my key
